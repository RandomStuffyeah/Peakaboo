XRF Visualization Software

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nsherry4/Peakaboo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nsherry4/Peakaboo)


Peakaboo allows users to identify the spectral origins of the XRF spectrum using a technique that fits all components of the K, L, or M spectrum including escape peaks and pileup peaks, and then plots their spatial intensity distributions as maps.
