Description: XRF Data Visualization and Analysis Tool
 .
 Peakaboo is an XRF visualization and analysis program which allows users to examine specrtral data from 0D, 1D, and 2D XRF scans. Users can select elements from a list, and the program will attempt to fit ideal elemental curves to the data as best as possible. 1D and 2D scans can also be mapped, showing the relative intensity of a given set of element across the scanned region.
